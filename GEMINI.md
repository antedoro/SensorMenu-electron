##Introduction
I want to build a standalone desktop application compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux in Electron

The app connects to a local MQTT server and subscribes to the topic "esp32/dht22", which provides data in JSON format:

{"temp": "21", "hum": "49"}

The latest temperature and humidity data are displayed directly in the macOS menubar or in the Windows/Linux notification area.

Initially, we will design and implement the app for macOS, keeping in mind future adaptation to Windows/Linux, considering each platform’s specific requirements.

## Interface Details

1. ### Menubar Integration (macOS)
Implemented using rumps, the macOS menubar displays real-time sensor data in the following format:

"dew_point_128 icon + temp °C - hum %"

This data is automatically updated upon receiving new messages from the MQTT broker.

When the user clicks on the menubar icon, a dropdown menu appears with the following options:

1. Activate/Pause → Start or pause the MQTT data stream
2. Check for updates… → Placeholder for future update-checking functionality
3. Settings → Opens the Settings window
4. About → Opens the About window
5. (Separator)
6. Quit → Closes the application

7. ### Settings Window
This window (size: 640x320 pixels) is built using settings.html. It allows users to configure the app’s behavior and MQTT connection parameters.

**UI Elements:**
 1. Open at login (checkbox)
 2. Check for updates automatically (checkbox)
 3. Show icon in menubar (checkbox)
 4. Show temperature (checkbox)
 5. Show humidity (checkbox)
 6. MQTT broker IP (text input)
 7. MQTT broker port (numeric input)
 8. MQTT topic (text input)
 9. Restore default settings (button)

The settings must be saved and loaded in an appropriate configuration file, stored in the standard user settings directory for each OS.

**Default MQTT configuration:**

* Broker IP/Port: localhost:1883
* Topic: esp32/dht22

3. ### About Window
This window (size: 325x325 pixels) is based on about.html and includes:

* App icon: assets/images/app_icon.png
* App name: "Temporary Name"
* Version info
* Footer:

# Development Notes
Refer to TODO.md to track implementation progress and match each feature with its corresponding task.
Ensure platform-specific behavior is respected when adapting to Windows/Linux later in development.


Look at setting.html for setting window, about.html for about window. app-icon.png anc dew_point_128 icon.png
